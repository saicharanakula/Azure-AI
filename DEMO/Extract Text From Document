To extract text from a document using Azure Form Recognizer, follow these steps:

Step 1: Set Up Azure Environment
Create an Azure Account:

Sign up for an Azure account if you don't have one.
Create a Resource Group:

In the Azure portal, create a new resource group to organize your resources.
Step 2: Create Azure Form Recognizer Resource
Navigate to Azure Portal:

Go to the Azure portal, search for "Form Recognizer," and create a new Form Recognizer resource.
Configure the Resource:

Provide a name, select a subscription, create or select a resource group, and choose a region.
Select the pricing tier based on your requirements and create the resource.
Step 3: Get the API Key and Endpoint
Access the Resource:

After creating the resource, navigate to it in the Azure portal.
Copy the Key and Endpoint:

Go to the "Keys and Endpoint" section to get the API key and endpoint URL.
Step 4: Prepare Your Document
Upload Document:
Ensure your document (PDF, JPG, PNG, etc.) is stored in an accessible location such as an Azure Blob Storage or local directory.
Step 5: Use the Form Recognizer REST API or SDK
You can choose to use either the REST API directly or an SDK (like Python) to interact with Form Recognizer.

Option 1: Using REST API
Submit a Request:

Use tools like Postman or curl to submit a request to the Form Recognizer endpoint.
bash
Copy code
curl -v -X POST "https://<your-custom-subdomain>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/formrecognizer/v2.1/layout/analyze" \
-H "Content-Type: application/pdf" \
-H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <your-api-key>" \
--data-binary @"<path-to-your-document>"
Get Analysis Results:

You will receive an operation ID in the response headers. Use this ID to get the results.
bash
Copy code
curl -X GET "https://<your-custom-subdomain>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/formrecognizer/v2.1/layout/analyzeResults/<operation-id>" \
-H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <your-api-key>"
Option 2: Using Python SDK
Install the SDK:

Install the Azure Form Recognizer client library for Python.
bash
Copy code
pip install azure-ai-formrecognizer
Write Python Code:

python
Copy code
from azure.ai.formrecognizer import FormRecognizerClient
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

endpoint = "<your-endpoint>"
api_key = "<your-api-key>"

form_recognizer_client = FormRecognizerClient(endpoint, AzureKeyCredential(api_key))

with open("<path-to-your-document>", "rb") as file:
    poller = form_recognizer_client.begin_recognize_content(file)
    result = poller.result()

for page in result:
    for line in page.lines:
        print(line.text)
Step 6: Process the Extracted Text
Extract and Utilize Text:
Process the extracted text according to your application's needs (e.g., store in a database, further analyze with NLP tools).
Step 7: Monitor and Improve
Monitor Usage:
Use Azure Monitor to track API usage and performance.
Refine Document Models:
If using custom models, continually train and refine your models to improve accuracy.
